    "\"Vinho Verde'' is a Portuguese wine which has three main variants, of which we will be considering red. In the kaggle dataset we are using from UCI Machine Learning, its quality is affected by 11 different physicochemical variables, such as acidity, chlorides, density, etc.. These 11 variables determine the quality of the wine, on a scale from 0-10. We will conduct our data analysis using three predictors from our dataset: total acidity, alcohol content, and pH. However, since total acidity is not technically within the dataset, we will have to combine the values of fixed and volatile acidity, creating a new column for total acidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ultimate goal is to create a k-nearest neighbors classifier (built off of our dataset) to classify the quality of various red wines at different price points that are sourced from outside of the dataset. This will ultimately help us determine whether or not the differences in the qualities of the wines generally correspond to their differences in price. We can rephrase this as a predictive research question: Using a k-means classifier, does a difference in the quality of a red wine reflect a difference in its price?"

    "#### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided on the three predictors outlined above due to the online accessibility of this information; many red wine companies do not share the finer contents of their wines, such as sulfur dioxide, density, volatile and citric acids, etc. However alcohol content, total acidity, and pH are far more easily found and therefore the best predictors to answer our question, especially important considering that we are sourcing wines from the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this proposal is a classification task, we will build a classifier to categorize wines as either good or poor in quality - for which we will be using the K-nearest neighbors classification algorithm. The classifier will be trained to recognize the quality of wine based on the three predictors outlined above. We will define good quality wine as having a quality rating over _6.5_ and anything below as poor quality - a threshold set by the creator of the dataset. The good quality wines will be assigned _1_ and the poor quality wines will be assigned _0_. This is done for the purpose of making a binary classifier, rather than a multiclass one, creating more concrete distinctions between the qualities of the wines and avoiding an unecessarily complex model that may have lower accuracy. Additionally, since each variable has a small range of values, it will already prove difficult to accurately classify each wine into such specific qualities. Thus, creating a binary classifier eliminates this problem, since there are only two, broad classes to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our preliminatory data visualization, we will use a ggpairs matrix to examine the general relationship between the wine class (good or poor) and our chosen predictors, giving us an idea of what parameters to expect in our classifier. The plot will help us see the mean values of each predictor that fall into either class. When we build the classifier, we will have to tune the number of neighbors and create a line plot to show at which *k* the classifier takes on the highest accuracy. These are the visuals to be expected."

The original dataset sets the threshold for a good wine at >6.5 and we followed this in our code. We called this new column \"new_quality\" to make it distinct from the existing \"quality\" column, and it only contains 0s and 1s to indicate the binary wine quality. In order to use total acidity as a predictor, we use the mutate function to combine the values of the two existing acidity columns.
